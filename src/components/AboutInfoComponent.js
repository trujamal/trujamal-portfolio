            <WelcomeHeader>Originally from Japan, I've traveled the globe exploring different cultues, and meeting diverse groups of people. This transformation has made me become the very person I am today as I coast along the diverse trends that exist within our society.</WelcomeHeader>
            <WelcomeHeader>I love nurturing great ideas into beautiful, functional, and profitable digital products. For over 5 years Iâ€™ve had the pleasure to work with agencies, start-ups and other companies across the globe on a wide range of projects â€” from the mobile UI/UX for an restaurant reservation system, to App Store featured mobile apps. Most recently I have been making great strides in building my personal startup <EmbededLink href="https://veveusa.com">Veve</EmbededLink> with currently 15+ employees.</WelcomeHeader>
            <WelcomeHeader>In 2018, I explored the Hackathon scene in which I personally participated in 4 different hackathon's over the year exploring how each and every one interacts. With this knowledge I'm planning on introducing some of the concepts I learned into Texas State.</WelcomeHeader>
			<WelcomeHeader>Alongside design and being student, I like to spend my time travelling, taking photos, creating portraits to photograph, and jamming to EDM.</WelcomeHeader>
